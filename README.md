# PROJECT 1

----------------------------------------------------------------------[STOCK MARKET OIL & GOLD]----------------------------------------------------------------------

# ◈ THE IDEA :

This project talks about a system for monitoring and analyzing oil and gold prices, as it provides a comprehensive and updated view of oil and gold prices.
It also makes it easier for the user to make investment and trading decisions.
And provide forecasts about future trends in oil and gold prices to help users plan and make future decisions.

# Note : Before the project moves on in an elementary way, take note that the written numbers are hypothetical guesses rather than actual figures.
# ◈ WHAT CAN THE USER DO ?

1- The user can review the gold prices, what countries export it, and what currency the country adopts in exporting.
2- It is also possible to know the countries that import oil and what is the available cost for a country to import.
3- Also, the user can know the price of gold, any country that can export gold, the type of gold that the country is exporting,
and any currency that the export deals with.
4- The user can also know which countries import gold and what is the possible cost for this country
5- The user can also know the price of one share in oil and provide the user with a calculation of the number of shares
that the user can buy in the future from any site that provides the purchase of shares.
6- Also, the user can calculate the grams of gold that he wants to buy later, as the type of gold is available,
and the calculation differs for each gram according to the type of gold
7- He can view a chart related to (gold, oil, and companies that provide oil stocks).

# ◢ There are some things that the user must be careful to enter, and the type of input that he must enter, is it an integer or a text string.

# ◈ WHAT CAN THE SUPERVISOR DO :

- The supervisor has the right to modify, delete and add to this data.
- Where the user must enter the password and username so that he can view
  the data that he wants to make changes to.


# ◈ HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS :

1- You must make all the files inside one folder, because they depend on each other.
2- You must download the aforementioned libraries so that you can run the program without the presence of unknown things that have not been identified.
# 3- In the function file:-
- The functions on which the options depend have been defined in the main file, which you will see inside the folder, where the data 
  classes have been placed in the form of a table so that the output is clear and understandable to the user.
- Also, the options were placed inside a function, where the options were arranged in the form of a list, and a loop (for) was used.
# 4-In the resources file:-
  Classes have been defined as each class contains attributes and data has been set for these attributes.
- Where there is a class called (importing countries) that inherits from the previous two classes, which 
  are (export oil and gold soutce).
- It also contains a list of the type (dictionary) of the shares provided by the company and the type of share.

# 5- In the main file:
- which was mentioned earlier in (function).
- Here specifically, it will deal with all summons for all classes and funchkins.
  You can say that main is the last interface for executing this program and exiting dat.

# ◈ LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN USED :

- A library was used to manipulate and display the graph (matplotlib).
- Also, the coloram library was dealt with.
- And dealing with the library of icons added to the project (rich)
- In libraries rich.Console library was used and Console call.
- Also, a follower of this library, I used (rich.table) so that I can display the data in an orderly manner inside a table.
- Also, I used from this library (rich.panel) - here it is meant to use it to leave the title you want inside a frame like
  a painting and it should be in a clear and attractive format.

# ◈ RECOMMENDATIONS :

- The project is simple as it is subject to development and addition, and this project can deal with trained economic data.
- Real data can also be developed in terms of data links that have been trained to suit the project.
- As the project is subject to development in all respects, and it is only the beginning of an idea until it is developed later.
